## Introduction

## Methods

### Site Selection

This project will focus on the city of Dresden. In order to provide an answer to the main research question “what areas of Dresden would stand to gain the most from the urban stream restoration project?” a division of areas has to be provided. To start, a grid with tiles of 500 by 500 metres was defined for the city of Dresden. This is filtered to only show the tiles which contain a stream to remove any unnecessary information.

### Map Dashboard
Still W.I.P. but if you open cmd, use 'python -m http.server' and navigate to the directory with the index.html in it, it works. Just need to figure out how to get it directly into our qmd file, haven't looked into that yet.
